# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
We are working with a nonprofit called Alphabet Soup to analyze the impact of each donation for the potential recipients.
This helps avoid faulty organizations to prevent wasteful donations of our resources using:
-TensorFlow to help with visualization of models
-Machine learning by constructing data sets and models
-Deeping learning by creating neural network models for our prediction and modeling for TensorFlow.

# Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
Data was processed as seen in the AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb and AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.

# Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model

# Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
####What variable(s) are considered the target(s)&  featuresfor your model?
-- The variabless and targest that are considered into creating our models were

-- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
-- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
-- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
-- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
